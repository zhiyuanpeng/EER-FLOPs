This folder contains experimental results for recording FLOP counts and latency on Qwen2.5 and Flan-T5 model series with the DL19 and DL20 datasets and various set sizes.

The files are named by [model_name]\_[dataset]\_[num_child].csv.

In each file, each row correpsonds to a query. The lists contain the results from running the setwise algorithm to rerank top-100 documents.
